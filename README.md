# Churn Prediction

## What is Churn?

Churn refers to customers who are likely to disengage or become inactive over time. This can be indicated by a lack of account activity, reduced usage compared to previous levels, or a decline in services or purchases.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to:

1. Identify and visualize factors contributing to customer churn.
2. Build a prediction model to classify if a customer is likely to churn.
3. Choose a model that provides a probability of churn, allowing customer service to target potentially churned customers more effectively with minimal effort.

## How?

We will approach this using the following methods:

1. **Deep Learning (Sequential Model):** Construct a neural network by stacking layers on top of each other to analyze complex patterns in the data.
2. **H2O AutoML:**
   - Open-sourced and in-memory machine learning platform.
   - Offers linear scalability and utilizes algorithms like gradient boosting, generalized linear models, and deep learning.

## Project Timeline

1. **Data Analysis:**
   - Explore data to identify relationships and patterns.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Preprocess data to prepare it for modeling.
3. **Model Building:**
   - Implement machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
4. **Model Building with AutoML:**
   - Utilize H2O AutoML to automate model selection and tuning for improved performance and efficiency.
